  # Project description:
  The focus of the project is on the correct design and development of a database using MySQL.  The project also requires advanced use of SQL and data extraction for analysis purposes


# Use Case for Rating System
This is a description of the individuals and systems involved in the rating system addition to the Campus Eats database.

It can include the following and only references the interaction with the ratings system:

Actors: (individuals involved)

Campus members:  order food, view ratings (only campus members can participate)
Drivers:  students approved to drive, view their driver ratings
Restaurants:  Get approved to be a part of the system, view ratings
Administrator(s):  individuals that manage the rating system, view reports

There may be other interactions but this is a start.  Generally your procedures and queries relate to a part of hte "use case" for example viewing driver ratings would be a request by admin or a driver.
